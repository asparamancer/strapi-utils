# Strapi Utils

This is a collection of utilities that I've created to make my lifes easier in working with [Strapi](https://strapi.io).

## What's inside?

This is a turborepo monorepo using [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages:

### Packages

- `strapi-client`: a generic API client for Strapi
- `strapi-plugin-search`: a rewrite of [Mattie Belt's plugin](https://github.com/MattieBelt/mattie-strapi-bundle)
- `strapi-provider-search-algolia`: a rewrite of [Mattie Belt's provider](https://github.com/MattieBelt/mattie-strapi-bundle)

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).``
